Q1: How do I download the files?
A: If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the entire code, hit the green button saying "Code", and then choose the "Download ZIP" option.

After downloading, extract the files.

Open the file in VS code or any editor.

Open the terminal (make sure you are in the right directory project_name in this case) and write command npm install or npm i to install all the dependencies.

After downloading the dependencies close all terminal.

Open new terminal and write command npm run server to start the server.

Open another terminal and write command npm run dev to start the localhost.

Open the local saying "http://localhost:5173/" in your browser.

And you can see the website.
